# React Hooks Demo

I just wanted to try some hooks, okay?!

I haven't gotten very far yet. Next I'd like to demo `useEffect()` and `useReducer()`.

## Usage

To install:

```
git clone https://github.com/lukemorton/react-hooks-demo.git
cd react-hooks-demo
npm install
```

To run in browser:

```
npm start
```

To run tests:

```
npm test
```
